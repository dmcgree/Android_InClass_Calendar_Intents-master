    <string name="march10_2016">THURSDAY, MARCH 10, 2016</string>
    <string name="altworthPeaceJusticeDescription">Erica Chenoweth, Ph.D., is an associate professor at the Josef Korbel School of International Studies at the University of Denver and an associate senior researcher at the Peace Research Institute of Oslo.\nAn internationally recognized authority on political violence and its alternatives, Foreign Policy magazine ranked her among the Top 100 Global Thinkers in 2013 for her efforts to promote the empirical study of civil resistance.</string>
    <string name="cambiataDescription">Haydn wrote more than 120 works of chamber music to satisfy the passion Prince Nikolaus Esterhazy had for playing his beloved baryton. Tonight we offer a rare opportunity to hear this unusual stringed-instrument. Penny Schwarze, baryton, will be joined by Ron Kari, viola, and Betsy Husby, cello, in a performance of charming trios composed for the Princeâ€™s pleasure. The program will also include one of Haydn\'s piano trios, featuring LeAnn House performing on a replica of an 18th-century piano.</string>
