    <string name="cambiataDescription">Haydn wrote more than 120 works of chamber music to satisfy the passion Prince Nikolaus Esterhazy had for playing his beloved baryton. Tonight we offer a rare opportunity to hear this unusual stringed-instrument. Penny Schwarze, baryton, will be joined by Ron Kari, viola, and Betsy Husby, cello, in a performance of charming trios composed for the Princeâ€™s pleasure. The program will also include one of Haydn\'s piano trios, featuring LeAnn House performing on a replica of an 18th-century piano.</string>
