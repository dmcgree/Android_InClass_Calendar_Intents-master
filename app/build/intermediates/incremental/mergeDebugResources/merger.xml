        short fiction following Smoke and Mirrors and Fragile Things—which includes a never-before published American Gods story, “Black Dog,” written exclusively for this volume.  In this
        new anthology, Neil Gaiman pierces the veil of reality to reveal the enigmatic, shadowy world that lies beneath. Trigger Warning includes previously published pieces of short
        fiction—stories, verse, and a very special Doctor Who story that was written for the fiftieth anniversary of the beloved series in 2013—as well “Black Dog,” a new tale that revisits
        the world of American Gods, exclusive to this collection.  Trigger Warning explores the masks we all wear and the people we are beneath them to reveal our vulnerabilities and our
        truest selves. Here is a rich cornucopia of horror and ghosts stories, science fiction and fairy tales, fabulism and poetry that explore the realm of experience and emotion. In
        Adventure Story—a thematic companion to The Ocean at the End of the Lane—Gaiman ponders death and the way people take their stories with them when they die. His social media
        experience A Calendar of Tales are short takes inspired by replies to fan tweets about the months of the year—stories of pirates and the March winds, an igloo made of books, and a
        Mother’s Day card that portends disturbances in the universe. Gaiman offers his own ingenious spin on Sherlock Holmes in his award-nominated mystery tale The Case of Death and Honey.
        And Click-Clack the Rattlebag explains the creaks and clatter we hear when we’re all alone in the darkness.  A sophisticated writer whose creative genius is unparalleled, Gaiman
        entrances with his literary alchemy, transporting us deep into the realm of imagination, where the fantastical becomes real and the everyday incandescent. Full of wonder and terror,
        surprises and amusements, Trigger Warning is a treasury of delights that engage the mind, stir the heart, and shake the soul from one of the most unique and popular literary artists
        of our day.</string><string name="rating">Save rating</string><string name="book1Summary">From Harper Lee comes a landmark new novel set two decades afer her beloved Pulitzer Prize winning masterpiece, To Kill a Mockingbird.

        husband, Antoine, as he heads for the Front. She doesn\'t believe that the Nazis will invade France … but invade they do, in droves of marching soldiers, in caravans of trucks and
        tanks, in planes that fill the skies and drop bombs upon the innocent. When a German captain requisitions Vianne\'s home, she and her daughter must live with the enemy or lose
        everything. Without food or money or hope, as danger escalates all around them, she is forced to make one impossible choice after another to keep her family alive.  Vianne\'s sister,
        Isabelle, is a rebellious eighteen-year-old girl, searching for purpose with all the reckless passion of youth. While thousands of Parisians march into the unknown terrors of war,
        she meets Gäetan, a partisan who believes the French can fight the Nazis from within France, and she falls in love as only the young can … completely. But when he betrays her,
        Isabelle joins the Resistance and never looks back, risking her life time and again to save others.  With courage, grace and powerful insight, bestselling author Kristin Hannah
        captures the epic panorama of WWII and illuminates an intimate part of history seldom seen: the women\'s war. The Nightingale tells the stories of two sisters, separated by years and
        experience, by ideals, passion and circumstance, each embarking on her own dangerous path toward survival, love, and freedom in German-occupied, war-torn France-a heartbreakingly
        beautiful novel that celebrates the resilience of the human spirit and the durability of women. It is a novel for everyone, a novel for a lifetime.</string><string name="instruction">Select a book to review</string></file><file path="C:\Users\Dana\AndroidStudioProjects\McGree_MiniProject\McGree_MiniProject\app\src\main\res\values\styles.xml" qualifiers=""><style name="AppTheme" parent="AppBaseTheme">
